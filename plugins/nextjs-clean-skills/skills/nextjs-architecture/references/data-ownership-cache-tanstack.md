# Data Ownership, Cache, And TanStack

**Impact: HIGH**

Pick one owner for each read path.

| Need | Default owner |
| --- | --- |
| Read-heavy dashboard/list/detail | RSC + server-only DAL + serializable props |
| UI create/update/delete | Server Action -> use-case -> cache invalidation |
| External service/API command | Route Handler -> use-case -> JSON response |
| Realtime, polling, infinite scroll, optimistic client lifecycle | TanStack Query |
| URL-shareable filters/tabs/paging | URL search params, not a client store |

Do not back the same read with both RSC props and `useQuery`. Do not use TanStack Query in Server Components. Do not wrap a Server Action in `useMutation` only to invalidate a TanStack key when the affected read is RSC-owned.

Cache Components and tag APIs are framework syntax. The architecture decision is simpler:

- RSC-owned reads invalidate server cache tags.
- TanStack-owned reads invalidate/update TanStack keys.
- mixed pages must document which subset each owner controls.

For `cacheLife`, `cacheTag`, `revalidateTag`, `updateTag`, and `router.refresh()` syntax, fetch current Next.js docs.
